# Theory-Of-Algorithms
## Description of this repository 
This repository on my github account is for the project for Theory of Algorithms, a module taught by Dr. Ian McLoughlin for 4th Year Software Development in Galway-Mayo Institute Of Technology(G.M.I.T).<br>
For this project we were asked to write must write a program in the C programming language to calculate the SHA512 value of an input file. This program must take the name or path of the file as a command line argument and output the SHA512 digest of it. We also could't use any external libraries other than the libraries that are included in the C standard library. The program must compile using `gcc` or `clang` and also have to include a `Makefile`. which compiles it upon make being called in the project folder.
